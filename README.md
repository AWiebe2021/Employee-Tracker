# Employee Tracker 

## Description 

**SQL Challenge: Employee Tracker**

**Challenge Elements**\
Developers frequently have to create interfaces that make it easy for non-developers 
to view and interact with information stored in databases. These interfaces are called 
content management systems (CMS). Your challenge this week is to build a command-line 
application to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.





## Installation

Because this application won’t be deployed, you’ll also need to provide a link to a walkthrough 
video that demonstrates its functionality and all of the tests passing. You’ll need to submit a 
link to the video and add it to the README of your project.
